As my wonderful internship at Element AI draws to an end, I've tried to reflect on things I've learned here and summarized
some of the high-level lessons in this post (in no particular order). Though I was doing research in deep learning, I hope people 
from many different backgrounds find these useful. Views are my own :)




## Lesson 1 - Document everything

Research involves a lot of detailed thought and the last thing you want to do is forget your precious insights.
Whether it's debugging your code or coming up with a new idea, documenting your work and thoughts is cruicial to being time-efficient - and ultimately, effective. 
You don't want to be in a position where you're wondering which of your 4 approaches produced the best result last week  (been there done that). 
Good, detailed documentation helps you maintain your stream of thought that you can access at any time later on - helping you
make well-informed decisions about your project over a longer period of time.




## Lesson 2 - Think long-term

Yea, and I'm not just talking about eating healthy in Montreal. 

Getting this down is particularly hard since your working memory (what you're curently thinking about) tends to be the anti-thesis of this very objective.  

Firstly, I think long-term thinking is at the heart of writing good code. I read somewhere that "Code is read much more often than it is written", so don't be the person using variable 'b' for batch-size. 
Make the context-switch to your code easier for yourself and 
the person who'll be working with your code afterwards. 

It's really easy to make finishing a working script your primary objective, but the modest efforts that go into ensuring code modularity and readability can translate into tens of hours saved down the road. 

Secondly, a good long-term thinker can be effective at prioritizing tasks. 
This is something I particularly struggled with. With the exciting growith in many areas of deep learning, it's easy
to throw yourself at multipled exciting problems. I too was in this place of short-term excitement about different problemss before realizing it made much more sense to finish 
a specific project to the end and have something to show for it.




## Lesson 3 - Talk to yourself

Not in a weird or narcissistic way (though I have nothing against that), but realize that feedback loops are critical for your growth. And not just any feedback,
but feedback that naturally lends itself to the fundamental changes you need to make. Here are some talking-to-myself moments I've had
"I haven't been able to find the bug in my code in the last two weeks - maybe I should re-evaluate my assumptions about every module?"
" 
"The last time I had poutine was a month ago, am I missing out on life?"

It's very easy to get caught up in the inertia of a particular project. Taking a moment to honestly assess your progress can push you to seek help, re-evaluate your approach, take a small break, for example, and ultimately help solve whatever problem you're facing. 




## Lesson 4 Feed yourself endorphines

When the going gets tough and anxiety starts to kick in, look for the small victories. Clean up your desk, make that trivial "code cleaned" commit that you've been putting off - make any sort of progress you can.
Pushing through and accomplishing even the minutest of things, in my experience, can be enough to sustain the motivation you need to get the job done. In summary, don't give up (yep, I just used that clich√©).
