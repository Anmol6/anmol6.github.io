##That is the question

What is "thinking from first principles"?
Heck, what is thinking? and what are "first principles"?
Well, the way I just dissected the question is one small example of what this post is about.

It may not surprise you that an Engineering student like myself idolizes Elon Musk.
But beyond the aura of a real-life Iron Man, there is a lot of value in figuring out how someone
is able to tackle problems in such diverse fields - from aerospace to solar cities(oh, and succeed!).

Elon's ability to absorb so much fascinated me from the moment I learned
of him, and it made me explore the art of learning.
During high-school days, I spent most of my spare time reading books on Physics and Engineering. My usual approach was to read up on a subject,
gain some intuition, glance at the forumlas and vaguely agree with their sanity. Since I did fine in my classes, so I didn't realize the gaps in my own knowledge. 
This all changed in college.

I remember picking up Gilbert Strang's *Linear Algebra* book and being amazed by both the elegance of the author's thought process and the presence of
rigor. After reading some more books in computer science and statistics, I realized one very improtant thing - that *it is critical to have rigorous formulations
of the fundamental principles*, when approaching any technical subject. 




In Elon's words, "First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say,
 What are we sure is true â€¦ and then reason up from there". 
 
This thinking approach has helped me tackle rather complicated ideas with ease. As someone who reads about a lot of technical things, helping a fundemntal 
understanding leads to a natural knowledge tree, with the fundamental ideas being the roots and branches just extensions of  these fundamental truths.
