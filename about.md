<p>Hi! I'm an Engineering Physics undergrad at the University of British Columbia.
My interest revolve around building useful technologies that can solve important
world problems, particularly those faced by struggling communities. As an Engineering
Physics student, I benefit from both the perspective of 'first principles' thinking,
and the knowledge of engineering applications. </p>

<p> Outside of class, I'm deeply vested in learning about machine learning and particularly
follow recurrent models for Natural Language Processing. I also enjoy the thrill of problem
solving, and am an avid competitive programmer. </p>

<p> I'm always open to meeting new people and working on new things - feel free to reach out!</p>
